# Roblox Scripts Portfolio

This repository showcases my Roblox Lua scripting skills, including gameplay systems, UI, and mechanics.

**Core Skills:**  
- Frontend & Backend scripting  
- UI development and Tween animations  
- Datastores and player data management  
- AI/NPC behavior and Pathfinding  

Many scripts are integrated with full game systems. All client-server interactions, even those not fully shared here, were developed by me. A deeper walkthrough or demonstration of these systems can be provided upon request.
